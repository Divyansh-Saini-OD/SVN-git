<h3>Do I need to notify my bank to start processing eCheck payment(s)?</h3>
<p>Some banks require suppliers (i.e., Office Depot) to be listed as 'authorized' to direct debit a bank account.  You should contact your bank to confirm their requirements.  If your bank requires an authorization and one is not setup, the payment to Office Depot may be rejected by your bank.</p>
<h3>Are there any service charge fees for making a payment by ECheck?</h3>
<p>No.  Office Depot does NOT charge any fees for making a payment by ECheck.</p>
<h3>How will the transaction show on my bank statement?</h3>
<p>You will see a charge for the dollar amount processed with a description of <em> "OFCDEPOT ECHECK BILL MGMT" </em>.</p>
<h3>When will the funds be deducted from my bank account?</h3>
<p>Please allow 2-3 <u>business days</u> for this charge to be reflected in your checking/savings account.</p>
<h3>Can a confirmation email be generated at the completion of this payment?</h3>
<p>Yes.  You can highlight the confirmation page, and copy/paste into an email to yourself.  If you called into our Customer Service team, please ask the agent to email the confirmation page to you.</p>
<h3>Can a confirmation email be generated at the completion of this payment?</h3>
<p>Yes.  You can highlight the confirmation page, and copy/paste into an email to yourself.  If you called into our Customer Service team, please ask the agent to email the confirmation page to you.</p>

<h3>What is the customer's receipt number?</h3>
<p>The customer's confirmation number for bank reference is displayed on the confirmation page as the "Bank Confirmation Number".   The customer's receipt number is generated at the time of payment and displayed on the confirmation page as the "OD Payment Number".</p>

<h3>What does the Effective date mean on the confirmation page?</h3>
<p>This is the next business day after the payment is taken and is when our bank begins processing the payment.  It is also the "payment date" that will appear on your bank statement.</p>

<h3>What assurance do I have that my banking information is safe?</h3>
<p>Your Bank account number will be masked on the confirmation page that is attached to the receipt.</p>


<h3>Is eCheck available in Canada?</h3>
<p> eCheck is only available in the US.  </p>

<h3> What are the minimum and maximum amounts of payment that can be accepted by eCheck?</h3>
<p> The minimum payment amount must be $1.00 and the maximum payment amount cannot exceed $500,000.  If you need to make a payment of more than $500,000, then multiple payments will need to be processed. The minimum and maximum amount are not determined by Office Depot but by the banks.</p>

<h3> If a payment was made in error or I change my mind, can the payment be cancelled?</h3>
<p> Maybe.  The payment can only be cancelled if we are notified before 5:00 PM EST on the same day the payment is made.  If it is the same day, please email "Cash-Research@OfficeDepot.com" with "REVERSE ECHECK PAYMENT" in the subject line.  We can un-do the transaction like it never happened.  If it is next day or after, we will  reverse the application and send you a refund check once the payment clears.
